## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
### What I learned

The one thing I learned was creating variables in CSS. That helped the
development process to move quickly.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
:root {
  --Inter: 'Inter', sans-serif;
  --Deca: 'Lexend Deca', sans-serif;
  --light-violet-transparent: hsla(277, 64%, 61%, 0.705);
  --light-violet: hsl(277, 64%, 61%);
  --white: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
  --body-white: hsla(0, 0%, 100%, 0.75);
  --stats-heading-white: hsla(0, 0%, 100%, 0.6);
  --background-color: hsl(233, 47%, 7%);
}
```

### Continued development

Moving forward I would like to focus on more complex designs using
only CSS and improved responsive designs. I also aim to improve my
design skills.
